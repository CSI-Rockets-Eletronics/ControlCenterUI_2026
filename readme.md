First, install a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

We use bun as the package manager and runtime. See https://bun.sh for
installation instructions.

Next, install the dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

To run the dev server, which has hot reloading:

```sh
bun dev
```

During actual operation, build the production bundle:

```sh
bun build
```

Then, use the following command to serve the bundle:

```sh
bun preview --host
```
